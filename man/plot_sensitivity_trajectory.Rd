\usage{
plot_sensitivity_trajectory(
  object,
  type = c("B_BMSY", "F_FMSY"),
  mp = object@MPs,
  slots = c("D", "hs", "M", "ageM", "L50", "Linf", "K", "Isd"),
  probs = 0.3
)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{A MSEtool MSE object.}

\item{type}{Whether to make a B/Bmsy or F/Fmsy projection plot.}

\item{mp}{A character vector of MPs to plot (must be included in the MSE
object). Defaults to all.}

\item{slots}{A character vector of OM slots to plot. Will be plotted in this
order. Set \code{slots = "all"} to plot all available OM and observation slots.}

\item{probs}{A numeric value corresponding to the tail probability for the ribbon.
E.g., 0.5 corresponds to a ribbon at 0.25 and 0.75 quantiles.}
}
\value{
A ggplot object
}
\description{
Plot sensitivity of performance metrics to OM slots across iterations as
trajectories. First the iterations are divided into the upper and lower
thirds of the respective OM slot values. Then ribbon plots are made within
those groups across iterations through time.
